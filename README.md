# PDF-AI-Assistant-using-OpenAI-and-HuggingFace


This project harnesses the power of OpenAI's Large Language Model and HuggingFaceInstructEmbedding, integrated with a FAISS vector datastore, to enable the processing of multiple PDF files. This integration facilitates the creation of an AI assistant that can respond to user queries based on the content of the PDFs.

The application is designed for deployment on a local server using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for interaction.

To use the application, users must generate a .env file and populate it with their OpenAI API Key. This step is crucial for the successful operation of the application.

The application's dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file, which can be easily installed. Once the dependencies are in place, users can launch the application through the Python terminal with the following command:
streamlit run code1.py

This streamlined process allows users to leverage the capabilities of the AI assistant efficiently and effectively.
